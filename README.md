# LED-Cube
This project contains the schematics and pictures of an 8x8x8 RGB LED Cube assembled from the iCubeSmart company.
While the actual design and software is created from iCubeSmart, it is the responsibility of the client to build 
the 8x8x8 LED Cube using the material provided by iCubeSmart. The LED Cube contains 30 preloaded animations 
automatically added to the STM32 processor.
